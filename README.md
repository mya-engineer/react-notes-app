# Notes App (ToDoList React Classic)

This repo contains src code for Note App, which allows to store your notes, manage them on MoDeRn kanban board, historify notes and a bunch of future functionality that I have not added yet. Originally implemented with Firebase Google.

**Demo** is availiable [here](https://react-todolist-v2.web.app/)

- Bootstrap is used here
- For animations used [react-spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring)
- For "Drag And Drop" used [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)
